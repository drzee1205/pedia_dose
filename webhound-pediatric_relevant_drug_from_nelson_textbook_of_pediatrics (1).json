Taking oxycodone regularly during pregnancy can lead to life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn after birth. Alcohol and certain other medications can significantly increase the risk of serious side effects when taken with oxycodone. Extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and should not be chewed, broken, crushed, or dissolved, as this can lead to rapid absorption and potentially fatal overdose. Oral solutions come in regular and concentrated forms, requiring careful measurement to ensure correct dosing."

Oral bioavailability is low due to first-pass metabolism. It crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Morphine is extensively metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in urine. Caution is advised in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, pregnant and breastfeeding women, pediatric patients (with specific guidelines for opioid-exposed infants), and older adults (due to increased delirium risk). Many drug-drug interactions can occur, including with CNS depressants, muscle relaxants, mixed agonist/antagonist opioids, cimetidine, MAOIs, anticholinergics, and P-glycoprotein inhibitors.

            "U.S. Boxed Warnings: Cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events (e.g., stroke, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction) from combination oral contraceptive use, especially in women over 35 years old. Combination oral contraceptives are contraindicated in women over 35 years who smoke. Endometrial cancer: Use of unopposed estrogens increases the risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus. Adding a progestin reduces this risk. Cardiovascular disease: Estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease due to increased risks of stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction. Breast cancer: Estrogen-plus-progestin therapy has been shown to increase the risk of invasive breast cancer. Dementia: Estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years or older due to an increased risk of developing probable dementia. Other special notes: This medication does not prevent AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases. It is not effective as emergency contraception. A second form of contraception (e.g., condom, spermicide) should be used for the first 7 days of the first cycle. Pills must be taken at the same time each day; missing or delaying a pill by more than 24 hours can increase the risk of pregnancy. Vomiting or diarrhea within 3-4 hours of taking the medicine should be treated as a missed dose. Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided. Regular check-ups with a doctor are crucial. Use with caution in patients with a history of angioedema, cervical cancer, chloasma gravidarum, cholestasis during pregnancy, depression, diabetes, dyslipidemia, gallbladder disease, hyperkalemia, or controlled hypertension."

Renal impairment: Use caution in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients due to limited data, high protein binding hindering removal during dialysis, and concerns about adverse effects/overdose. Pregnancy: Crosses the placenta. Often used in early pregnancy for nausea/vomiting. ACOG recommends doxylamine and pyridoxine combination as preferred. Common adverse reactions include sedation, constipation, and drowsiness. Breastfeeding: Higher doses/prolonged use may lead to sedation, irritability, or reduced milk supply. Non-sedating antihistamines are preferred. High doses can decrease prolactin levels. Avoid use during lactation. Pediatric: Accidental ingestions common (ages 2-4). Adverse events include tachycardia, somnolence, hallucinations, mydriasis, agitation, seizures (less frequent). Fatalities rare, often associated with child abuse/homicide. PBPK model can aid in personalizing dosing. Older patients: Possesses strong anticholinergic properties; generally avoided per American Geriatric Society guidelines. May be used for acute allergic reactions under strict monitoring."
